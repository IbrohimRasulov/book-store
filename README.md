# Capstone Project

> The project I am going to build for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online shop for books. 
The webpage looks like <a href="https://www.notion.so/ZATTIX-design-full-view-ed43f6bdfe0144608d4f2fc18758e81a">This sample</a> page.
The website is fully responsive with the help of media query breakpoints and bootstrap. This project has been built with help of modern CSS3 and Bootstrap 4.
